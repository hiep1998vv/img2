The KMK Monitoring System is a comprehensive tool designed to ensure and control the quality of printers by monitoring the performance of their individual components. This project aims to provide insights into the impact of various child parts on the overall quality of the printer, visualize the tendencies of these parts, analyze the combination of data affected by the child parts, and issue warnings in case of the occurrence of worst-case scenarios.

Features:

Component Performance Visualization: The system provides visualizations of the performance tendencies of individual child parts of the printer. This includes metrics such as failure rates, error occurrences, and efficiency trends.

Data Combination Analysis: It analyzes the combination of data affected by different child parts to identify correlations, dependencies, and potential causes of quality issues. By understanding how various components interact, the system can pinpoint areas for improvement.

Quality Control Alerts: The system is equipped with algorithms to detect and flag instances of worst-case scenarios or significant deviations from expected performance. When such occurrences are detected, alerts are generated to notify relevant stakeholders, enabling timely intervention to rectify issues.

User-friendly Interface: The system features an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows stakeholders to easily navigate through different visualizations, access relevant data, and interpret insights. Interactive dashboards provide real-time updates and customizable views for different user roles.

Historical Data Analysis: Historical data is stored and analyzed to track the performance of child parts over time, identify patterns, and predict potential quality issues before they occur. This proactive approach helps in implementing preventive measures to maintain product quality standards.

Objectives:

Provide insights into the performance of child parts of printers.
Analyze the impact of child parts on overall printer quality.
Identify and address potential quality issues before they impact product performance.
Enhance decision-making by providing actionable insights based on data analysis.
Improve overall product quality and customer satisfaction.
Benefits:
